## Reflection Questions

- Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were able to complete an elaborate plan for our project. We built a detailed wireframe on figma that ilustrates the general layout and workflow of our website. We collected and incorporated some input from the mentors such as having a landing page that speaks of the mission of VanLyfe.

- What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

Design work was a little challenging. No one in the team had used Figma, so this was a learning opportunity for all of us. After a lot of trial and error we discovered Figma MUI which greatly aided our design process. It was also the first time we worked using the Agile methodology.At the begining of the week, it was challenging to define the scope of Epic, stories and milestones, but we have gotten better at it now that we know our optimum working pace.

- Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes we finished all the sprint work for the week and infact touched on a little bit of the next sprint work, ie setting up some of the backend requirements.

- Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

The TA's and mentors were the most impactful resource.They promptly answered all our questions and offered helpful suggestions. As for the tools, we are glad to have learned Figma because it made our design elaborate and very easy to work with. Likewise, we found Sprint planning on Github to be a very effective strategy in managing the team's work and timelines.

- Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

All of this week's stories were attainable.
