## Reflection Questions

* How was the pacing of the capstone project? (i.e too slow, just right, too fast) 


Although we left out some features because of the time constraint, the time was enough to complete all the required core features along with some stretch features.

* To what extent did your plan change over the course of development? Knowing that you know now, what would you do differently if you were starting over?


At the planning phase of our development we made a list all the features implement but there were few changes we had to made once we started development. For example we initially planned to have a chat feature for our customer to reach out to the hosts, but we ended up sending emails instead. 

* How helpful were the labs and weekly assignments in preparing you to create a capstone project? Be specific, what topics do you still have questions about that may or may not have been covered?


All the labs were super helpful. Almost everything was covered in the labs, but some of the things we added outside of the labs are Twilio SendGrid, AWS S3 and MUI framework.  

* When planning for the capstone project, which resources were the most helpful? (i.e mentors, instructors & TAs, ideation process, pod syncs, wireframes, sprint planning, bug bash, practice demo day, etc.)


All of the above. The TAs, our instructor and the weekly suggestions of our mentors were all helpful in each phase of our project.
