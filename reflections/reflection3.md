# Reflection #3

Pod Members: **Add Pod Members Names**

## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were successful at connecting the frontend with the backend. By the end of the week, almost all of the pages were functional and storing data in the database. We also wrote unit tests for the backend. 

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

We were unsure on how we should be storing images. Fortunately, our mentors were kind enough to list out different ways to do it.

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Our goal for this week is to meet the Minimum viable product for our project. Although we did not get everything entirely done, I say we made a very good progress this week. And also, there were fewer merge conflicts compared to last week.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Github projects is super helpful in tracking our progress as a group. It allows us to create and assign issues for each team member to meet the sprint goal of the week.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

There isn't any feature we think is at risk. I believe that by the next week we would be able to finish up the core features of the project and deploy.
