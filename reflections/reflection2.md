## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

We were successful at completing our epics for this sprint, including initializing the project front-end, creating the dummy listing grid, and creating other aspects of the website, like the navbar and footer.

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

It was a challenge to work as a team on the same repo. At the beginning of the week, we did not pull from main often and we ended up having branches that were many commits behind main. Now, we pull from main every morning after the daily stand up. We also faced the challenge of learning to use MUI to create the layout of the frontend. We are all new to using MUI so it was a challenge to get familiar with the library. 

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

We did finish all of our tasks this week and in fact, we did more than we had planned. After finishing the epics to complete the Week 7 milestone, we created new Github issues for the user stories that we wrote for the Week 8 milestone and assigned them to those who finished their work early. For Week 8, we plan to have more tasks ready for those who finish early.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

Github issues and Github projects are great platforms for creating and assigning tasks for the week. We create an issue for each user story and add a label corresponding to the epic and milestone. 

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

The book listing feature is at risk because there are problems with this feature that we have not discussed solutions for. One is how to store the availability of the vehicle in the listing on the database. The second is how to upload and store images. Before we complete this task, we must agree on solutions to these problems. If we cannot figure out a solution in a timely manner, we will have to scrap those two parts of the feature and complete the rest.
