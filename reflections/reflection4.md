## Reflection Questions

* Name at least one successful thing this week.

 We managed to finalise on the project MVP and fix a few hidden bugs in the program

* What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

 Figuring out efficient ways to fully test our application and ensure any bugs and edge cases are fixed before the demo

* Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks, how would you prioritize the remaining tasks on your list?  (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)

Yes we finished all of our sprint plan tasks for this week. We had planned to finalise on the MVP and we managed to complete that.

* Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

 The TAs were helpful in helping us figure out a favorites stretch feature we were planning on implementing. Also, the SQL challenges we did on the 5th week of the program really helped in updating our backend database to handle the same.

* Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

 In terms of our MVP there aren't really any features at risk.
