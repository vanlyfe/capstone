# Project Plan

Pod Members: **Ammar Fakih, Joram Bosire, Edilawit Tsehay, Vernon Otieno**

## Problem Statement and Description

Problem Statement: People have few options when it comes to finding affordable housing in urban areas in the United States.

Description: 

The main purpose of our project is to provide an affordable housing option for people staying in the city. Our product allows for people to rent their car to others.

How it works: Enter a location and date and browse thousands of cars shared by local hosts. Book online, choose a protection plan, and say hi to your host! Cancel for free up to 24 hours before your trip. Have the car delivered or pick it up from your host. Once you are done with your stay, leave a helpful review.
