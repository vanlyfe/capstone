Pod Members: Ammar Fakih, Vernon Otieno, Edilawit Tsehay, Joram Bosire

## Problem Statement

Problem Statement: People have few options when it comes to finding affordable housing in urban areas in the United States.

Target Audience: Low to moderate income adults who are living in an urban area.

## Description

What is the main purpose of your project? What are the key features your site has to offer its users? How will your targeted audience use your website?

## Expected Features List

Add a list of your groups's brainstormed features list

## Related Work

Similar apps and websites are Airbnb, Outdoorsy, Escape Camper Vans, and GoCamp. Airbnb is geared towards house and apartment rentals. Our project is focused on renting motor vehicles. The rest of the listed websites are geared towards travelers and campers. Our app is focused more on repurposing vehicles for customers to sleep in when staying in the city. 

## Open Questions

We still need to research how to set up a scheduling and tracking system. We also need to research how to set up an insurance service for both customers and renters. Lastly, we will research the best target location(s) for this app.
