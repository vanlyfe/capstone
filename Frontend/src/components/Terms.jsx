        <h4>1. Searching and Booking on VanLyfe</h4>
        <Typography>
          You can search for Host Services by using criteria like the type
          Vehicle, travel destination, travel dates, and number of guests. You
          can also use filters to refine your search results. Search results are
          based on their relevance to your search and other criteria. Relevance
          considers factors like price, availability, Reviews, previous trips
          and saved Listings, Host requirements and more.
        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
          When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your
          booking including the Listing price, applicable fees , taxes, and any
          other items identified during checkout. After you book a listing, we
          will send you a confirmation email of the status of your order within
          the next 24 hours. In addition to these Terms, you will be subject to,
          and responsible for complying with, all terms of the Reservation,
          including without limitation, the cancellation policy and any other
          rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing
          or during checkout that apply to the Reservation. It is your
          responsibility to read and understand these rules, standards,
          policies, and requirements prior to booking a Listing.

        </h4>
        <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
          In general, if as a Guest you cancel a Reservation, the amount charged
          to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that
          Reservation. But, in certain situations, other policies take
          precedence and determine what amount is charged to you. If something
          outside your control forces you to cancel a Reservation, you may be
          eligible for no fees under our applicable law. If the Host cancels, or
          you experience a Travel Issue, you may be eligible for rebooking
          assistance .

        <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
          Guests and Hosts are responsible for any booking modifications they
          agree to make via the VanLyfe Platform and agree to pay any additional
          amounts, fees, or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.{' '}

        <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
          You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are
          also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to
          join or provide access to any Accommodation, Experience or other Host
          Service. For example, this means: 1. you are responsible for leaving
          an Accommodation in the condition it was in when you arrived, 2. you
          are responsible for paying all reasonable Damage Claim amounts
          necessary to cover damage that you, your guest, or your petcause to an
          Accommodation, and 3. you must act with integrity, treat others with
          respect, and comply with applicable laws at all times. If you are
          booking for an additional guest who is a minor or if you bring a minor
          to a Host Service, you must be legally authorized to act on behalf of
          the minor and you are solely responsible for the supervision of that
          minor.{' '}

        <h3>Host Terms</h3>
        <h4>1. Creating and Managing Your Listing</h4>
        <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
          Your relationship with VanLyfe is that of an independent individual or
          entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of
          VanLyfe. VanLyfe does not direct or control your Host Service, and you
          agree that you have complete discretion whether and when to provide
          Host Services, and at what price and on what terms to offer them.
        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
          The VanLyfe Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set
          up and manage a Listing. Your Listing must include complete and
          accurate information about your Host Service, your price, other
          charges like cleaning fees, resort fees and any rules or requirements
          that apply to your Guests or Listing. You are responsible for keeping
          your Listing information (including calendar availability) and content
          (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times. We recommend that
          you obtain appropriate insurance for your Host Services and suggest
          you carefully review policy terms and conditions including coverage
          details and exclusions. You may only maintain one Listing per Vehicle.
        </Typography>
        <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
          You are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws,
          rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to
          your Listing or Host Services. For example: In some places, the Host
          Services you want to offer may be prohibited altogether. Some
          jurisdictions require that you register Guests who stay at your
          Accommodation. Check your local rules to learn what rules apply to the
          Host Services you plan to offer. Information we provide regarding
          legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should
          independently confirm your obligations.

        <Typography sx={{ mt: 2 }}>
          The ranking of Listings in search results on the VanLyfe Platform
          depends on a variety of factors, including these main parameters:

          You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are
          also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you allow to
          participate in providing your Host Services. You are responsible for
          setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your
          Listing. You must describe any and all fees and charges in your
          Listing description and may not collect any additional fees.

          As a host, you should not cancel on a Guest without a valid reason

          any discriminatory, offensive, defamatory, or other language that
          violates our Policy. Reviews are not verified by VanLyfe for accuracy
          and may be incorrect or misleading.
